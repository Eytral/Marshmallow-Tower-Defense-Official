# Developer Retrospective
### What went well
- I managed to successfully implement most game systems, including wave, entity and UI management, with mostly clean separation of logic.
- I implemented a 2D array grid-based map.
- Using the pygame library was mostly smooth, as it was not my first time utilising the library. 
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) proved to be incredibly useful in organising my code, making the implementation of different entity types (e.g. projectile, enemy, tower types) and state management much smoother.
- Project architecture aided in trying to achieve clean separation of logic

### Challenges Faced
- Learning fundamental OOP principles was a challenge, as it was my first time formally trying to do so.
- Learning to use pytest was also a challenge, as it is an unfamiliar library to me.
- The largest difficulty came to me when learning how to make a state management system, and running my game around that, as it was a rather novel concept to me.
- Obviously implementing a save/load system was too challenging for me to implement in this short a time frame, as my experience in file writing and/or RDBMSs is still limited.
- Some functions were quite difficult to implement, most notably the enemy pathfinding and projectile predictive trajectory functions.
- A final challenge for me was learning how to utilise git/github for version history control, an aspect in which I still have much to learn (in terms of organisation and description of commits and branches).
- I actually faced some challenge in the use of the dictionary data type, an essential data type for this project, as I had not utilised them much before this project.
- Balancing the game to make it playable was an unprecedented challenge, to ensure the gameplay loop was enjoyable/felt somewhat rewarding.

### Lessons Learnt
- One of the largest lessons learned in the development of this project is of course OOP, as I learn to utilise encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction in my code.
- I still have work to do in properly following good programming principles (commenting as I code, and code readability/formatting)
- I have learned the importance and utility of version control in facilitating code management and error recovery.
- I learned how important it is to scope realistically, as some features (like saving/loading) were too complex to implement within the given time.
- As I developed this project independently, I learned how to manage my own time, scope the project realistically, and problem-solve with the help of tools available to me.


This project has given me a solid foundation in OOP and game development, and I look forward to applying these principles to more advanced systems in the future. :)
